## Overview
CBD Continuum was the first CBD wellness retail store in Apex, North Carolina.  
Founded and operated by Meg Montañez-Davenport, board certified in holistic nutrition (NANP/HNCB) with a doctoral background in naturopathic medicine and specialization in orthomolecular medicine, the business transformed a former smoke shop into a modern wellness facility introducing evidence-based, natural alternatives to the local community.  

The facility offered holistic, orthomolecular, and nutrition-based health solutions, promoting plant-derived therapies as part of whole-person care.  
Under Meg’s direction, the space redefined community health culture—converting a site once associated with smoking into a clean, educational, wellness-centered environment.
