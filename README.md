# CBD Continuum Retail


## Overview
CBD Continuum was the first CBD wellness retail store in Apex, North Carolina.  
Founded and operated by Meg Montañez-Davenport, board certified in holistic nutrition (NANP/HNCB) with a doctoral background in naturopathic medicine and specialization in orthomolecular medicine, the business transformed a former smoke shop into a modern wellness facility introducing evidence-based, natural alternatives to the local community.  

The facility offered holistic, orthomolecular, and nutrition-based health solutions, promoting plant-derived therapies as part of whole-person care.  

The product line was formulated to align with orthomolecular and evidence-based principles—each designed to target a specific physiological or emotional need using natural actives:

- 🍏 [**Anxiety Relief — Apple (Quercetin)**](CBD-Products/Mockups/Tincture%20Mockup%20-%20Apple%20flavor%20(1).png): Formulated for calm and antioxidant support through modulation of inflammation and neuroprotection.  
- 🫐 [**Mood Support — Mixed Berry (Anthocyanins)**](CBD-Products/Mockups/Tincture%20Mockup%20-%20Berry%20flavor%20(1).png): Designed for mild depression and cognitive clarity via anthocyanin-driven neurotransmitter balance.  
- 🍋 [**Detox — Lemon (Citrus Bioflavonoids)**](CBD-Products/Mockups/Tincture%20Mockup%20-%20Lemon%20fl%20(1).png): Promotes hepatic detoxification and immune resilience through vitamin C synergy.  
- 🌙 [**Sleep — Blueberry & Lavender (CBN Blend)**](CBD-Products/Gummies/CBD%20Gummies.jpg): Combines CBN isolate with lavender terpenes for circadian rhythm and restorative rest.  
- 🍍 [**Smokable Nutrients — Pineapple (Bromelain Blend)**](CBD-Products/Flower/CBD%20Flower%20Label%20Print%20Files/): A non-tobacco herbal inhalable delivering bromelain, micronutrients, and terpenes for respiratory clarity and relaxation.  
  


Under Meg’s direction, the space redefined community health culture—converting a site once associated with smoking into a clean, educational, wellness-centered environment.
