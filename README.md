# CBD Continuum Retail

## Overview
CBD Continuum was the first CBD wellness retail store in Apex, North Carolina.  
Founded and operated by Meg Montañez-Davenport, board certified in holistic nutrition (NANP/HNCB) with a doctoral background in naturopathic medicine and specialization in orthomolecular medicine, the business transformed a former smoke shop into a modern wellness facility introducing evidence-based, natural alternatives to the local community.

The facility offered holistic, orthomolecular, and nutrition-based health solutions, promoting plant-derived therapies as part of whole-person care.

**Formulation lineup (orthomolecular, evidence-based):**
- 🍏 [**Anxiety Relief — Apple (Quercetin)**](https://github.com/Future-Systems-Lab/CBD-Continuum-Retail/blob/main/CBD-Products/Mockups/CBD%20Oil%20Mock-Ups/Tincture%20Mockup%20-%20Apple%20flavor.png): Formulated for calm and antioxidant support through modulation of inflammation and neuroprotection.

**Sustainable packaging & materials**
- 🌿 Hemp-based cartons and recyclable glass to reduce petroleum plastics  
- ♻️ Eco-friendly, soy-based inks on FSC-certified stock for labels and inserts  
- 🌱 Plant-derived adhesives and biodegradable void fill for shipping  
- 🚚 Right-sized packaging and batch shipping to cut transport emissions  
- 🔁 Reuse program guidance for bottles and droppers to extend lifecycle  

Under Meg’s direction, the space redefined community health culture—converting a site once associated with smoking into a clean, educational, wellness-centered environment.

## Public Health and Community Impact
- **Education & Access:** Provided in-person consultations on holistic nutrition, amino acid therapy, and cannabinoid science.  
- **Integrity & Quality Assurance:** Implemented voluntary **Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)** in an unregulated CBD market.  
- **Transparency:** Every in-house product was analyzed by independent third-party laboratories with published Certificates of Analysis ([Certificates of Analysis (COA)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tvREuhYeRJmxsUtvD9ZT1K9SloyoRu6Y/view?usp=sharing)).  
- **Pandemic Response:** During COVID-19, organized a wellness delivery program for the sick and homebound.  
- **Reputation:** Recognized locally for reducing stigma around natural medicine and improving the aesthetic and cultural tone of the neighborhood.  

## Evolution
Following the physical store phase, operations transitioned online to expand access to verified formulations and to begin developing the **digital health and blockchain ecosystem** that evolved into **Future Systems Lab** projects such as [EncryptHealth](https://github.com/Future-Systems-Lab/EncryptHealth) and [HypnoNeuro](https://github.com/Future-Systems-Lab/HypnoNeuro).
